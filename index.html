<!-- Short funny story of my life -->
<h4>A funny story</h4>
<p>Once I went skiing with some friends and in the late afternoon on our last descent we stopped at a bar.<br> You can guess, after a little too much alcohol I wasn't able to do the last descent.<br> I went down on my stomach and everything was covered in snow.</p>

<!-- TL;DR -->
<h6>Too long;Didn't read:</h6>
<p>Don't ski and drink or you'll come down with clothes full of snow. </p>
